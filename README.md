# Loan-Analysis
# Loan Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes loan data to understand borrower trends, risk factors, and loan performance. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to extract key insights from the dataset.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Loan data from Lending Club
- **Columns:** 111 features including loan amount, interest rate, borrower credit history, loan grade, and repayment status
- **Size:** Large dataset with missing values requiring preprocessing

## Analysis Performed
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Identified and removed columns with excessive missing values (> 65%)
- Handled inconsistencies to ensure accurate analysis

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Loan Defaults:** Higher default rates in lower-grade loans (A to G)
- **Seasonal Trends:** Most loans are granted in December and the latter half of the year
- **Loan Amounts:** Distribution of loans across different credit grades and interest rates

## Results & Key Insights
- **Risky Borrowers:** Loans with lower grades (G, F) are more likely to default
- **Lending Patterns:** Lending activity spikes in December, suggesting seasonal demand
- **Interest Rates:** Correlate with riskiness; lower-grade loans have higher interest rates
